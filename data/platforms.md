How can you invest in the Nigerian stock market?

What investment can you start with ₦10,000? [...] Along with curating the stocks with long-term payoffs, Rise has investment experts and professionals to manage these investments on behalf of users. Compared to other platforms, Risevest. Risevest and its subsidiary, Chaka, accumulate a customer base of 620,000 users. The app is accessible on your smartphone on the Play Store or App Store.

TL;DR: Invest in dollar-denominated assets

### 3. Trove

Along with providing a platform to invest in over 4,000 US and Nigerian assets, Trove also offers learning resources through its product, Trove University, where you can learn about investing and earn points. You can then use your points to redeem rewards such as airtime or data, and trading fee credits. [...] ### 2. Risevest

Risevest allows you to make dollar-dominated investments in Global and U.S markets, including U.S real estate. These investments can yield returns ranging from 8% to 15%.

However, Rise is not a brokerage app, but functions as a digital wealth or asset manager. It does not offer direct trading. But rather curates and presents portfolios in US stocks, US real estate, and global fixed income assets, to balance risk and reward, while you choose how much you want to invest.

### 2. Chaka

image 25
image 25

Like Bamboo, Chaka also provides Nigerians and businesses access to over 4,000 foreign and Nigerian stocks, making it an excellent choice for diversifying their portfolios. The SEC-regulated platform allows users to open dollar and naira accounts, giving them flexible investment management across different currencies.

Trading fees range between 0.69% and 1.5% for foreign investments, with a 0.5% or₦100 broker commission fee for Nigerian stocks.

Although Future Africa-backed fintech doesn’t offer investment recommendations, it has a “Knowledge Base” to help users get started and an educational blog that was last updated in 2021. Some users have reported challenges with withdrawal speed. [...] ### Are these investment platforms safe?

Yes, each platform is regulated. However, investing always carries risks. Review each platform’s policies and understand the terms before investing.

### Can I invest in foreign stocks from Nigeria?

Yes, platforms like Bamboo, Chaka, and Trove allow Nigerians to invest in foreign stocks right from Nigeria.

### What are the fees associated with these platforms?

Fees vary by platform. For platforms offering foreign investments, look out for management, transaction, and currency conversion fees.

## Conclusion [...] This platform is particularly suitable for those who want exposure to international markets. The fintech offers fractional shares (only for its US stocks), making it accessible to small-scale investors. With your BVN, you can use the app from anywhere in the world.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the app and offers fixed returns and Treasury bills. Some users report delays in transaction processing.

Techpoint Africa reported that the company launched a fee-free remittance app — ‘Coins by Bamboo’ — to facilitate money transfers from the diaspora to Africa.

Pro tip: If you’re uncertain about what to invest in right away, Bamboo’s US Wallet feature allows you to hold funds in USD, protecting them against inflation until you’re ready to invest.

Trading apps are making Nigerian equities more accessible, but costs vary in ways that impact investor returns.
We compared fees across Cowrywise, Bamboo, and i-invest using 100 Transcorp shares at ₦50.05 each. Here’s the outcome:
- Bamboo: ₦5,189.94 — lowest overall, with 1% brokerage
- I-invest: ₦5,620.62 — mid-range, cheaper alerts but slower on fee updates
- Cowrywise: ₦5,695.62 — most expensive, but protects investors with a built-in trade buffer
The takeaway:
- Bamboo is best for lowest cost per trade
- Cowrywise offers smoother execution and fewer surprises
- I-invest is the budget-friendly compromise
For retail investors, the decision depends on priorities. Transparency around fees is just as critical as the raw numbers.

## The Bamboo HR platform saves time and effort.

Bamboo HR is super easy to use, and navigating between different modules/employee records takes zero effort. The platform layout is logical and you can find employee details without a lot of senseless searching.   
Overall, the platform saves time and effort. That makes it worth a small fortune to me.

## Terrible Customer Service

I wish I came here before planning to invest in Nigerian stocks using Bamboo, the hype got me! I have been locked out of my account for 3 weeks now. Customer care service has been unresponsive, support@investment bamboo only sends automated message to let you know they have received your message and after that, no response. Three weeks now, no access, no email response, stock investment plan in the drain. Never follow media hype, please read reviews. Second time I have fallen victim of this with Nigerian investment companies. If I ever get my 50K out of their, never using the app again.

I've been using Bamboo for a little while now and even though I'm new to investing and it took me a little while to get used to the system, I like how easy it got after a couple of days of use.  
  
I also love that there's other options to grow your money including Treasury Bills and the Dollar Fixed Return.  
You can just stash spare money you're not using in there and have it work for you!

# Are IC wealth and Bamboo really good investment platforms?

I've been deliberating whether to just create a bank account and start my investment journey there but it seems it's a long process with different terms and conditions which I can't fulfill since I'm yet to find a job to do. On the other hand these apps provide flexibility with investments which allow to use my mobile money wallet to invest money. Please any advice will do.

# Riseworks.io withdrawal help!

Hi, I am not really asking for help for a specific prop firm, but I did take a payout from FundedNext into my Rise account. It is my first time taking a payout using this website and withdrawing it to my bank account. I was really just wondering if anyone with experience withdrawing from Rise could let me know the usual time it takes from withdrawing the money to seeing it in your bank account. someone on reddit said it usually takes about an hour for it to hit his bank account, but it has been the whole day for me and I still haven't got it. I also never got any type of email from rise or my bank saying the transfer was in progress.

Context:

I am located in Ontario, Canada. [...] Context:

I am located in Ontario, Canada.

I withdrew it this morning(Friday, Nov 21) at around 9am EST.

My bank is CIBC.

it says the status is complete on the invoices activity, could it be an issue with my bank?

should I have gotten some type of confirmation email when I placed the withdrawal?

could it be because it is my first withdrawal on Rise?

If anyone with knowledge on this topic could help, it would be appreciated!

### Withdrawal problem : r/RaizAU - Reddit
**Source**: https://www.reddit.com/r/RaizAU/comments/1n27903/withdrawal_problem/
So being the bright spark that I am (sarcasm), I said look that's ok, when the money comes through on RAIZ I'll just transfer $1500 back. So I instantly clicked withdraw $1500.

Anyways 1 business day later I suddenly get a notification that only $750 has been deposited into my account??? I check on my RAIZ account.... $1500 has definitely been withdrawn... so my question is... where is my extra $750 right now???

I understand that RAIZ has a 3-5 business day policy, but why deposit only half the money??? I'm so confused... called the bank and they said it was a RAIZ problem not theirs.... if anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated...

# Withdrawal problem

Hey guys so needing some assistance here... especially since dealing the banks has proven useless and RAIZ support closes really early...

Context:

The other day wanted to withdraw $750 out of my RAIZ account and deposit it back into my bank account.

I accidentally hit deposit instead of withdrawal (yes I know I'm idiot, this was already established) so RAIZ actually took $750 out of my account which meant the account was then... overdrawn as it had only like 0.34 cents in it (I do have more money than this but it was my spending vs. savings account).

### Retail trading apps in Nigeria face a defining moment - Quartz
**Source**: https://qz.com/africa/2051307/retail-trading-apps-in-nigeria-face-a-defining-moment
All four firms say that users’ investments are safe, that they can fund and withdraw from their accounts as usual. But a week after the order, an existential question remains: how will Risevest and co resolve the fundamental issues between them and Nigeria’s monetary sovereign?

## Fighting Nigeria’s inflation since 2014

Even if “Robinhood for Africa” is how these startups are described, they did not start off with a mission to provide commission-free trading to amateur retailers. [...] Perhaps he spoke too soon, because 19 days later, on Aug. 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze 15 bank accounts belonging to Risevest and the other three companies for 180 days.

The allegations against each company differ in some aspects: Risevest is accused of trading cryptocurrency against Nigeria’s ban in February, but the main complaint is that using dollars from Nigeria’s forex market to buy foreign stocks for users falls foul of a July 2015 directive, which placed purchases of Eurobonds and foreign currency shares on a list of banned items. [...] There are four startups that allow Nigerians to invest in shares of public companies on US exchanges. But unlike Trove, Bamboo, and Chaka, Risevest’s app is not for users who want to trade stocks; instead the company itself invests on users’ behalf. On July 22, Risevest said its stock portfolio and real estate plan had made 12% and 9.04% returns respectively since the beginning of the year.

A week after announcing those returns, Eleanya Eke, the startup’s CEO, tweeted: “All your funds on Risevest are parked in the US, completely immune to Nigeria’s issues. And can be sent to any bank account in 140 countries. That’s freedom,” with a rocket emoji at the end.

## Damaged goods, subpar support

Trove powers Lululemon's "like new" store, which does not have its own listing on TrustPilot.  
  
I was sent a pair of pants with a hole in the fly area. After a miserable experience with Support - being given the runaround and kicked to the top of the funnel multiple times - and even taking the pants to a retail location (they are restricted from helping with Trove's side of the business), the resolution they finally offered me was taking more time out of my day/wallet to return the item for a refund. They weren't even willing to offer a replacement.

Blessing Iyamadiken

Trove is an amazing company, allowing millennials like me to be able to buy shares in companies here in Nigeria and in the abroad. This is something I thought was only open to old people, so finding out that a millennial like me could even learn about finances was amazing. Did I mention that they also educate you about financial management, budgeting etc. Plus their customer care answers promptly.

 ### Great Company And Amazing Customer Service

  Blessing Iyamadiken

  Trove is an amazing company, allowing millennials like me to be able to buy shares in companies here in Nigeria and in the abroad. This is something I thought was only open to old people, so finding out that a millennial like me could even learn about finances was amazing. Did I mention that they also educate you about financial management, budgeting etc. Plus their customer care answers promptly.
