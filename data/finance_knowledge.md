### What Makes a Savings Account “High-Yield”?

A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers returns well above the national average.  
According to CBN data (February 2025), the average savings deposit rate stood at 7.96%, yet some digital platforms now offer rates as high as 28% per annum.

#### Why the Difference?

Digital banks and fintechs operate leaner, branchless models, allowing them to pass savings directly to customers through better rates and lower fees.

Pro Tip: Always confirm that the platform is CBN-licensed and NDIC-insured (up to ₦500,000 per depositor).

Here’s the reality:

 A regular savings account pays 1–3% interest. With inflation at 24%, you’re losing N21,000 for every N100,000 left in the bank yearly.
 But a money market mutual fund can deliver 17–20% returns — real profit that beats inflation.
 A balanced fund mixing bonds and stocks can aim for 20–25% over time.

Even better: You don’t have to watch the market every day. The fund manager does that for you.

### 5 Top-Ranked ETFs Beating the S&P 500 in 2024
**Source**: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-ranked-etfs-beating-sp-500-2024
In the current scenario, investors should bet on ETFs that have been winners so far this year and have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These are VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF AIRR, iShares U.S. Insurance ETF IAK, Invesco Large Cap Growth ETF PWB and Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF PPA. [...] Wall Street has been enjoying a strong rally this year, with the three major indices touching a series of record highs. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze, strong corporate earnings, and rate-cut optimism have been the major driving factors amid geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks, which weighed on investors’ confidence.   
  
Notably, the S&P 500 Index topped 5,800 for the first time and is up more than 22% since the start of the year. The solid trend will likely continue for the rest of the year, given the solid start of the third-quarter earnings season with companies issuing bolder forecasts due to the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle.

### Top 3 ETFs That Beat the Market in 2024 and Could Do It ...
**Source**: https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-3-etfs-that-beat-the-market-in-2024-and-could-do-it-again-200656420
The strength of the performance of the S&P 500 was undoubtedly helpful in drawing investor attention to ETFs, but the wide variety of strategies, approaches, asset classes represented, and other factors present across the space have combined to make ETFs ubiquitous. That said, choosing the "best" ETFs of 2024 to serve as a starting place for considering new investments in 2025 is difficult—some of the top-performing funds employ leverage and daily resets in an effort to amplify momentary returns of particular indices, making them poor choices for buy-and-hold investors. [...] SPMO enjoyed a one-year return as of January 15, 2025, of 46.8%, handily beating the broader market. This factor ETF adopts a common-sense approach: find large-cap stocks that have a recent history of strong price performance and focus in on them narrowly. The fund aims to identify 100 S&P 500 stocks that have outperformed their peers in the last year, excluding the most recent month, after adjusting for volatility.

Stock exchange-traded funds, or equity ETFs, are often low-cost, tax-efficient instruments for investors to track popular indexes or leverage experienced manager choices to beat the market. The best ones serve as low-cost building blocks in a portfolio, and unlike open-end mutual funds, all ETFs are traded throughout the day on an exchange. [...] The $3.9 billion Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF was the best-performing ETF in 2024, with a 45.81% return. The passively managed Invesco ETF beat the 21.26% gain on the average fund in Morningstar’s large blend category for the year. Over the last three years, the Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF has returned 15.29%, outperforming the 7.24% gain on the average fund in its category, leaving the ETF in the 1st percentile.

The Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Gold. It launched in October 2015.

### Africa Stocks Overtake US Shares as Top Performer in 2024
**Source**: https://www.investing.com/analysis/africa-stocks-overtake-us-shares-as-top-performer-in-2024-200651294
It’s debatable if this leadership change will resonate as a longer-term phenomenon. One reason for skepticism: Africa stocks (AFK) are rebounding from an extended two-year slump and so year-to-date comparisons obscure longer-run underperformance vs. the US market.

But for the moment, American shares (SPY) have lost bragging rights as the world’s leader via the ETF list below.

VanEck Africa Index ETF (AFK) closed on Friday (Aug. 23) with a 20.0% total return this year, edging out 19.0% rise for SPDR® S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).World Regional Equity Markets YTD Returns

# Africa Stocks Overtake US Shares as Top Performer in 2024

James Picerno

Earlier this month I discussed the possibility that the US stock market’s year-to-date performance would slip to second place as Africa shares rallied. Nearly two weeks later, the switch is complete, based on a set of proxy ETFs. [...] However, a calculated risk view suggests that keeping some skin in the international diversification game still has merit vs. the extreme view of sticking exclusively with the US.

That’s a contrarian view. But when the crowd’s generally convinced it’s right in the extreme, therein lies opportunity, or so history implies.

## Query: Eurobond yields for Nigerian banks 2025

### UnitedCapital Nigerian Eurobond Fund
**Source**: https://unitedcapitalplcgroup.com/factsheet/may-2025/United-Capital-Nigerian-Eurobond-Fund.pdf
MARKET REVIEW, OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY The Nigerian Eurobonds market experienced a notable recovery in May-2025, reversing the two consecutive months bearish run from the previous months (Mar-25 & Apr-25). Investor sentiment improved broadly, especially in mid-to-long-dated maturities such as those maturing in 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, and 2033, which saw yield declines of up to 140bps. [...] This recovery was supported by a combination of both global and domestic factors. On the domestic side, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held during the month resulted in a decision to maintain existing interest rates, providing stability and reassuring investors. The Nov-2025 Eurobond witnessed significant buy interest as yield declined by 115bps m/m to settle at 7.30%, the Nov-2027 Eurobond yield also declined significantly, falling by 127bps m/m to settle at 8.06%. The Feb-2030 Eurobond also saw notable yield buy interest, as yields dropped by 140bps m/m to settle at 9.38%. Additionally, fiscal concerns persisted, but the impact was somewhat offset by the positive effects of the coupon inflows of $148.57 million in May contrary to no inflows recorded in Apr-25. Globally, [...] The SSA Eurobonds witnessed substantial buy-interest, with prices rising significantly at the end of the month. Consequently, the Nigerian Eurobond average yield declined from the 10.57% to close the month at 9.56%.
Looking ahead, we expect the direction of geopolitical policies to drive market movement, affecting both developed and emerging markets. We expect to continue seeing buy interest in SSA Eurobonds, although at a lower rate.
We will continue to maintain the required allocation ranges in line with the Trust Deed and tactically pick higher yielding maturities in the sovereign bond space to enhance the performance of the Fund.

### Treasury raises 2 billion euros through Eurobond issue
**Source**: https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/treasury-raises-2-billion-euros-through-eurobond-issue-218620
The bond, maturing on March 10, 2034, has a coupon of 5.15 percent and a yield of 5.2 percent, the ministry said.

“The yield was below the fair value implied by the USD yield curve and was priced at approximately MS + 242 basis points, representing the lowest spread recorded among euro denominated issuances over the past 15 years,” it added.

With this issuance, the euro yield curve has been extended by approximately 2.5 years beyond its previous longest maturity of August 2031, it said.

The offering attracted an order book exceeding three times the issue size, with participation from nearly 180 accounts, according to the statement. [...] Hürriyet Daily News

The transaction was finalized with a nominal amount of 2 billion euros, it added. [...] Some 56 percent of the issue was allocated to investors in the U.K., 24 percent in other European countries, 9 percent in the U.S., 6 percent in the Middle East, 4 percent in Türkiye and 1 percent in other countries, it said.
